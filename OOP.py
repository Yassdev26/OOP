# ------------------------------------------
# -- Object Oriented Programming => Intro --
# ------------------------------------------
# [1] Python Support Object Oriented Programming
# [2] OOP Is A Paradigm Or Coding Style
#     OOP Paradigm =>
#       Means Structuring Program So The Methods[Functions] and Attributes[Data]
#       Are Bundled Into Objects
# [3] Methods => Act As Function That Use The Information Of The Object
# [4] Python Is Multi-Paradigm Programming Language [Procedural, OOP, Functional]
#     - Procedural => Structure App Like Recipe, Sets Of Steps To Make The Task
#     - Functional => Built On the Concept of Mathematical Functions
# [5] OOP Allow You To Organize Your Code and Make It Readable and Reusable
# [6] Everything in Python is Object
# [7] If Man Is Object
#     - Attributes => Name, Age, Address, Phone Number, Info [Can Be Differnet]
#     - Methods[Behaviors] => Walking, Eating, Singing, Playing
# [8] If Car Is Object
#     - Attributes => Model, Colour, Price
#     - Methods[Behaviors] => Walking, Stopping
# [9] Class Is The Template For Creating Objects [Object Constructor | Blueprint]
#     - Class Car Can Create Many Cars Object


# ---------------------------------------------
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# -- Object Oriented Programming => Class Syntax and Info --
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# [01] Class is The Blueprint Or Construtor Of The Object
# [02] Class Instantiate Means Create Instance of A Class
# [03] Instance => Object Created From Class And Have Their Methods and Attributes
# [04] Class Defined With Keyword class
# [05] Class Name Written With PascalCase [UpperCamelCase] Style
# [06] Class May Contains Methods and Attributes
# [07] When Creating Object Python Look For The Built In __init__ Method
# [08] __init__ Method Called Every Time You Create Object From Class
# [09] __init__ Method Is Initialize The Data For The Object
# [10] Any Method With Two Underscore in The Start and End Called Dunder or Magic Method
# [11] self Refer To The Current Instance Created From The Class And Must Be First Param
# [12] self Can Be Named Anything
# [13] In Python You Dont Need To Call new() Keyword To Create Object
# -------------------------------------------------------------------

# Syntax
# class Name:
#     Constructor => Do Instantiation [ Create Instance From A Class ]
#     Each Instance Is Separate Object
#     def __init__(self, other_data)
#         Body Of Function


class Member:

    def __init__(self):
        print("A New Member Has Been Added")


member_one = Member()
member_two = Member()
member_three = Member()

print(member_one.__class__)

my_dictionary = {
    'name': "Osama",
    'age': 36,
    'monthly_salary': 5000,
    'yearly_salary': ''  # Something
}
